1 Privacy generally
This privacy policy applies to the handling of personal information by Shabaas Pty Ltd (ACN 653

Shabaas understands the importance of protecting the privacy of an individual’s personal
information. This privacy policy sets out how Shabaas aims to protect the privacy of your personal
information, your rights in relation to your personal information managed by Shabaas and how

In collecting, holding, using, disclosing and otherwise managing your personal information,

Principles in the Privacy Act.
Shabaas will regularly review its policies and procedures regarding personal information and may

be made available on our website at www.shabaas.com.au or can otherwise be obtained by
contacting us and requesting a copy.

The kinds of personal information that Shabaas collects will vary depending on our particular
interactions or dealings with you. However, generally speaking, the kinds of personal information
Shabaas collects may include:

(b) information we may require to verify your identity such as your physical current address,
date of birth, mobile phone number, government identification information and other
personal information that we may require for identity verification purposes;
(c) information such as your expected transaction activity as well as ‘know-your-customer’
(KYC) information that we require for account opening and maintenance purposes;
(d) payment activity information from you when you transact using our payment services,

Generally, we do not collect sensitive information about individuals. Information about your health,
racial or ethnic origin, political persuasions, criminal record and religious or philosophical beliefs
are all examples of sensitive information. If we do need to collect sensitive information about you,
we will only do so with your consent or where we are required to do so by law (for example,
information about whether you are a politically exposed person or subject to other sanctions).
3 How we collect personal information
Generally, Shabaas collects your personal information directly from you. For example, Shabaas
may collect your personal information:
◼ when you use or apply to use our payment or other products or services;
◼ when you register for an account with us, request information or services or otherwise
provide us with your details;
◼ where you download or use our online, mobile or other applications or software;
◼ where you use our website or other services or otherwise interact with us;
◼ when you complete a survey or enter a promotion or competition; or
◼ if you post information to any of our social media sites.
There may be occasions when Shabaas collects your personal information from someone other
than you, for example:
◼ from your bank or other relevant financial institutions in order to provide our services to
you;
◼ from third parties you authorise to disclose your information to us;
◼ from a publicly maintained record or other publicly available sources of information
including social media and similar websites;

you; and
◼ from third parties for identity verification purposes or when performing any checks required
under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) or
other similar laws.
Generally, Shabaas will only collect your personal information from sources other than you if it is
unreasonable or impracticable to collect that personal information from you.

practices, as described in that site’s privacy policy. Those practices may be different than the
practices described in this privacy policy, and we encourage you to read each website’s privacy
policy carefully before you use or submit information to that site. Additionally, to the extent that
you follow a link to a website operated by an independent third party, please be aware that we
exercise no authority or control over that third party, and cannot and are not responsible for any
information that you may submit to that site.
9 Security of personal information
Shabaas takes steps reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the personal information it
holds is protected from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorised access, modification
or disclosure.
Your personal information will be kept on databases held on servers kept in a physically and
technologically secured environment, accessed only by authorised personnel or contractors.
Where personal information is held in hard copy, it will be held in controlled, access restricted
premises which only authorised personnel will be permitted to access.
We have in place procedures for training our employees about their obligations under this privacy
policy, disciplining them for failure to follow this privacy policy. We also have in place internal
procedures to confirm general company compliance with this privacy policy.
Shabaas will destroy or de-identify personal information in circumstances where it is no longer
required, unless Shabaas is otherwise required or authorised by law to retain the information.
Where you have an account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
